# Contributing to codonfriend

This package is developed as part of a regular "coding club" within our research centre.
Anyone is welcome to get involved, but maybe create an issue on GitHub to introduce yourself first!

## R packaging

This package is setup following the guidelines in Hadley Wickham's "R packages" book <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/>.
If you are unsure about why things are where they are or where you should put things, please consult that book first.


## Further info on R

I highly recommend that anyone with some familiarity with programming have a look at Hadley Wickham's "Advanced R" book <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/>.
It explains a lot about R's internal datastructures, what the difference between `[` and `[[` is, and an introduction to how classes work in R.


## Style guide

Having a consistent coding style is important for readability and comprehensibility.
We each develop our own little shortcuts for conveying information, but are rarely consistent with each other or even ourselves over time.
Please adhere to the style-guide layed out in the "Advanced R" book <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html> and defer to googles style guide where Hadley doesn't specify it <https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml>.
If you see that something doesn't adhere to that standard, please change it and submit a pull request.


## Useful tips

I'll flesh out a list of tips for working with `devtools` and Rstudio over the next little while.
The information will all be in the "R packages" book, but this will have copy-pasteable code snippets suitable for our project.
